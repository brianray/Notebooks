The model formula in the terminal node would then be used to generate the prediction.\n",

Because of the logic of their construction, they can effectively handle many types of predictors (sparse, skewed, continuous, categorical, etc.) without the need to pre-process them. In addtion, these models do not require the user to specify the form of the predictors' relationship to the response like, for example, a linear regression model requires. Furthermore, these models can effectively handle missing data and implicitly conduct feature selection, characteristics that are desirable for many real-life modeling problem.\n",

Two well-known weaknesses are (1) model instability (i.e., slight changes in the data can drastically change to structure of the tree or rules and, hence, the interpretation) and (2) less-than-optimal predictive performance. The latter is due to the fact that these models define rectangular regions that contain more homogeneous outcome values. If the relationship between predictors and the response cannot be adequately defined by rectangular subspaces of the predictors, then tree-based or rule-based models will have larger prediction error than other kinds of models.\n",

    "An advantage of tree-based models is that, when the tree is not large, the model is simple and interpretable. Tree models intrinsically conduct feature selection; if a predictor is never used in a split, the prediction equation is independent of these data. This advantage is weakened when there are highly correlated predictors. If two predictors are extremely correlated, the choice of which to use in a split is somewhat random. For example, the two surface area predictors have an extremely high correlation (0.96) and each is used in the tree shown in the above figure. It is possible that the difference between these predictors is strongly driving the choice between the two, but it is more likely to be due to small, random differences in the variables. Because of this, more predictors may be selected than actually needed. In addition, the variable importance value for each variable decreases.\n",

First, single regression trees are more likely to have sub-optimal predictive performance compared to other modeling approaches. This partly due to the simplicity of the model. By construction, tree models partition the data into rectangular regions of the predictor space. If the relationship between predictors and the outcome is not adequately described by these rectangles, then the predictive performance of a tree will not be optimal. Also, the number of possible predicted outcomes from a tree is finite and is determiend by the number of terminal nodes. This limitation is unlikely to capture all of the nuances of the data.\n",

The split that is associated with the largest reduction in error is chosen and a linear model is created within the partitions using the split variable in the model. For subsequent splitting iterations, this process is repeated: an initial split is determined and a linear model is created for the partition using the current split variable and all others that preceded it. The error associated with each linear model is used in place of $\\text{SD}(S)$ to determine the expected reduction in the error rate for the next split.

There are several possible reasons that the linear models may produce very different predictions. First, the number of training set samples that are available in a node will decrease as new splits are added. This can lead to nodes which model very different regions of the training set and, thus, produce very different linear models. This is especially true for small training sets. Secondly, the linear models derived by the splitting process may suffer from significant collinearity. Suppose two predictors in the training set have an extremely high correlation with one another. In this case, the algorithm may choose between the two predictors randomly. If both predictors are eventually used in splits and become candidates for the linear models, there would be two terms in the linear model for effectively one piece of information, which can lead to substantial instability in the model coefficients. Smoothing using several models can help reduce the impact of any unstable linear models."

First, an initial model tree is created (it is recommneded to use unsmoothed model trees). However, only the rule with the largest coverage is saved from this model. The samples covered by the rule are removed from the training set and another model tree is created with the remaining data. Again, only the rule with the maximum coverage is retained.

Bagging, short for *bootstrap aggregation*, was one of the earliest developed ensemble techniques. Bagging is a general approach that uses bootstrapping in conjunction with any regression or classification model to construct a ensemble. The model is fairly simple in structure and consists of the steps outlined below.\n",

These samples are called *out-of-bag*, and they can be used to assess the predictive performance courtesy of that specific model since they were not used to build the model. Hence, every model in the ensemble generates a measure of predictive performance courtesy of the out-of-bag samples. The average of the out-of-bag performance metrics can then be used to gauge the predictive performance of the entire ensemble, and this value usually correlates well with the assessment of predictive performance we can get with either cross-validation or from a test set.

Another disadvantage to this approach is that a bagged model is much less interpretable than a model that is not bagged.

    "Bagging trees (or any high variance, low bias technique) improves predictive performance over a single tree by reducing variance of the prediction. Generating bootstrap samples introduces a random component into the tree building process, which induces a distribution of trees, and therefore also a distribution of predicted values for each sample. The trees in bagging, however, are not completely independent of each other since all of the original predictors are considered at every split of every tree. One can imagine that if we start with a sufficiently large number of original samples and a relationship between predictors and response that can be adequately modeled by a tree, then trees from different bootstrap samples may have similar structures to each other due to the underlying relationship. This characteristic is known as tree correlation and prevents bagging from optimally reducing variance of the predicted values.

    "Random forests' tuning parameter is the number of randomly selected predictors, k, to choose from at each split, and is commonly referred to as $m_{try}$. In the regression context, it is suggested to set $m_{try}$ to be one-third of the number of predictors. For the purpose of tuning the $m_{try}$ parameter, since random forests is computationally intensive, we suggest starting with five values of k that are somewhat evenly spaced across the range from 2 to p. The practioner must also specify the number of trees for the forest. It is proved that random forests is protected from over-fitting. Practically speaking, the larger the forest, the more computational burden we will incur to train and build the model. As a starting point, we suggest using at least 1000 trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown that the linear combination of many independent learners reduces the variance of the overall ensemble relative to any individual learner in the ensemble. A random forest model achieves this variance reduction by selecting strong, complex learners that exhibit low bias. This ensemble of many independent, strong learners yields an improvement in error rates. Because each learner is selected independently of all previous learners, random forests is robust to a noisy response. At the same time, the independence of learners can underfit data when the response is not noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to bagging, random forests is more computationally efficient on a tree-by-tree basis since the tree  building process only needs to evaluate a fraction of the original predictors at each split, although more trees are usually required by random forests. Combining this attribute with the ability to parallel process tree building makes random forests more computationally efficient than boosting."

    "Our experience is that the random forest tuning parameter does not have a drastic effect on performance. In these data, the only real difference in the RMSE comes when the smallest value is used (10 in this case). It is often the case that such a small value is not associated with optimal performance. However, we have seen rare examples where small tuning parameter values generate the best results. To get a quick assessment of how well the random forest model performs, the default tuning parameter value for regression ($m_{try} = p/3$) tends to work well. If there is a desire to maximize performance, tuning this value may result in a slight improvment. Also, note that, use the out-of-bag error rate would drastically decrease the computational time to tune random forest models.\n",

    "The ensemble nature of random forests makes it impossible to gain an understanding of the relationship between the predictors and the response. However, because trees are the typical base learner for this method, it is possible to quantify the impact of predictors in the ensemble. One approach is to randomly permuting the values of each predictor for the out-of-bag sample of one predictor at a tiem for each tree. The difference in predictive performance between the non-permuted sample and the permuted sample for each predictor is recorded and aggregated across the entire forest. Another approach is to measure the improvement in the node purity based on the performance metric for each predictor at each occurence of that predictor across the forest. These individual improvement values for each predictor are then aggregated across the forest to determine the overall importance for the predictor.\n",

    "Boosting models were originally developed for classification problems and were later extended to the regression setting. Boosting, especially in the form of AdaBoost algorithm, was shown to be a powerful predictive tool, usually outperforming any individual model. The AdaBoost algorithm clearly worked, and after its successful arrival, several reseachers connected the AdaBoost algorithm to statistical concepts of loss functions, additive modeling, and logistic regression and showed that boosting can be interpreted as a forward stagewise additive model that minimize exponential loss. This fundamental understanding of boosting led to a new view of boosting that facilitated several algorithmic generalizations to classification problems. Moreover, this new perspective also enabled the method to be extended to regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"gradient boosting machines\" is a method stemmed from boosting's statistical framework, which emcompassed both classification and regression. The basic principles of gradient boosting are as follows: given a loss function (e.g., squared error for regression) and a weak learner (e.g., regression trees), the algorithm seeks to find an additive model that minimizes the loss function. The algorithm is typically initialized with the best guess of the response (e.g., the mean of the response in regression). The gradient (e.g., residual) is calculated, and a model is then fit to the residuals to minimize the loss function. The current model is added to the previous model, and the procedure continues for a use-specified number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described throughout this text, any modeling technique with tuning parameters can produce a range of predictive ability -- from weak to strong. Because boosting requires a weak learner, almost any technique with tuning parameters can be made into a weak learner. Tree, as it turns out, make an excellent base learner for boosting for several reasons. First, they have the flexibility to be weak learners by simply restricting their depth. Second, separate trees can be easily added together, much like individual predictors can be added together in a regression model, to generate a prediction. And third, trees can be generated very quickly. Hence, results from individual trees can be directly aggregated, thus making them inherently suitable for an additive modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When regression trees are used as the base learner, simple gradient boosting for regression has two tuning parameters: tree depth and number of iterations. Tree depth in this context is also known as *interaction depth*, since each subsequential split can be thought of as a higher-level interaction term with all of the other previous split predictors. If squared error is used as the loss function, then a simple boosting algorithm using these tuning parameters is listed below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Select tree depth, D, and number of iterations, K\n",
    "Compute the average response, $\\bar{y}$, and use this as the initial predicted value for each sample\n",
    "for k = 1 to K do\n",
    "    Compute the residual, the difference between the observed value and the current predicted value, for each sample\n",
    "    Fit a regression tree of depth, D, using the residuals as the response\n",
    "    Predict each sample using the regression tree fit in the previous step\n",
    "    Update the predicted value of each sample by adding the previous iteration's predicted value to the predicted value \n",
    "    generated in the previous step\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Clearly, this version of boosting has similarities to random forests: the final prediction is based on an ensemble of models, and trees are used as the base learner. However, the way the ensembles are constructed differs substantially between each model. In random forests, all trees are created independently, each tree is created to have maximum depth, and each tree contributes equally to the final model. The trees in boosting, however, are dependent on past trees, have minimum depth, and contribute unequally to the final model. Despite these differences, both random forests and boosting offer competitive predictive performance. Computation time for boosting is often greater than for random forests, since random forests can be easily parallel processed given that the trees are created independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosting machine could be susceptible to over-fitting, since the learner employed -- even in its weakly defined learning capacity -- is tasked with optimally fitting the gradient. This means that boosting will select the optimal learner at each stage of the algorithm. Despite using weak learners, boosting still employs the greedy strategy of choosing the optimal weak learner at each stage. Although this strategy generates an optimal solution at the current stage, it has the drawbacks of not finding the optimal global model as well as over-fitting the training data. A remedy for greediness is to constrain the learning process by employing regularization, or shrinkage. In the above algorithm, instead of adding the predicted value for a sample to previous iteration's predicted value, only a fraction of the current predicted value is added to the previous iteration's predicted value. This fraction is commonly referred to as the *learning rate* and is parameterized by the symbol, $\\lambda$. THis parameter can take values between 0 and 1 and becomes another tuning parameter for the model. Small values of the learning parameter ($<$0.01) works best, but the value of the parameter is inversely proportional to the computation time required to find an optimal model, because more iterations are necessary. Having more iterations also implies that more memory is required for storing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation, *stochastic gradient boosting*, borrows some idea from bagging techniques. It inserts the following step before line within the loop: randomly select a fraction of the training data. The residuals and models in the remaining steps of the current iteration are based only on the sample of data. The fraction of training data used, knownas the bagging fraction, then becomes another tuning parameter for the model. It turns out that this simple modification improved the predictive accuracy of boosting while also reducing the required computational resources. "
