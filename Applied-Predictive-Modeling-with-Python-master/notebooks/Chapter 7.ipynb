    "Neural networks are powerful nonlinear regression techniques inspired by theories about how the brain works. Like partial least squares, the outcome is modeled by an intermediary set of unobserved variables (called *hidden variable* or *hidden units*). These hidden units are linear combinations of the original predictors, but, unlike PLS models, they are not estimated in a hierarchical fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously stated, each hidden unit is a linear combination of some or all of the predictor variables. However, this linear combinationis typically transformed by a nonlinear function $g(\\cdot)$, such as the logistic (i.e., sigmoidal) function: $$h_k(\\pmb{x}) = g \\left( \\beta_{0k} + \\sum_{j=1}^P x_j\\beta_{jk} \\right), \\text{where} \\\\ g(u) = {1\\over 1+e^{-u}}.$$ The $\\beta$ coefficients are similar to regression coefficients; coefficient $\\beta_{jk}$ is the effect of the $j$th predictor on the $k$th hidden unit. A neural network model usually involves multiple hidden units to model the outcome. Note that, unlike the linear combinations in PLS, there are no constraints that help define these linear combinations. Because of this, there is little likelihood that the coefficients in each unit represent some coherent piece of information.\n",
    "\n",

Another linear combination connects the hidden units to the outcome: $$f(\\pmb{x}) = \\gamma_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^H \\gamma_kh_k.$$ For this type of network model and $P$ predictors, there are a total of $H(P+1)+H+1$ total parameters being estimated, which quickly becomes large as $P$ increases."

    "Treating this model as a nonlinear regression model, the parameters are usually optimized to minimize the sum of the squared residuals. The parameters are usually initialized to random values and then specialized algorithm for solving the equations are used. The back-propagation algorithm is a highly efficient methodology that works with derivatives to find the optimal parameters. However, it is common that a solution to this equation is not a *global* solution, meaning that we cannot guarantee that the resulting set of parameters are uniformly better than any other set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, neural networks have a tendency to over-fit the relationship between the predictors and the response due to the large number of regression coefficients. To combat this issue, several different approaches have been proposed. First, the iterative algorithms for solving for the regression equations can be prematurely halted. This approach is referred to as *early stopping* and would stop the optimization procedure when some estimate of the error rate starts to increase (instead of some numerical tolerance to indicate that the parameter estiamtes or error rate are stable). However, there are obvious issues with this procedure. First, how do we estimate the model error? The apparent error rate can be highly optimistic and further splitting of the training set can be problematic. Also, since the measured error rate has some amount of uncertainty associated with it, how can we tell if it is truely increasing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to moderating over-fitting is to use *weight decay*, a penalization method to *regularize* the model similar to ridge regression. Here, we add a penalty for large regression coefficients so that any large value must have a significant effect on the model errors to be tolerated. Formally, the optimization produced would try to minimize a alternative version of the sum of the squared errors: $$\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - f_i(x))^2 + \\lambda\\sum_{k=1}^H\\sum_{j=0}^P \\beta_{jk}^2 + \\lambda\\sum_{k=0}^H \\gamma_k^2$$ for a given value of $\\lambda$. As the regularization value increases, the fitted model becomes more smooth and less likely to over-fit the training set. The value of this parameter must be specified and, along with the number of hidden units, is a tuning parameter for the model. Reasonable values of $\\lambda$ range between $0$ and $0.1$. Also note that since the regression coefficents are being summed, they should be on the same scale; hence the predictors should be centered and scaled prior to modeling."

There are many other kinds, such as models where there are more than one layer of hidden units (i.e., there is a layer of hidden units that models the other hidden units). Also, other model architectures have loops going both directions between layers. There have also been several Bayesian approaches to neural networks. The Bayesian framework automatically incorporates regularization and automatic feature selection. This approach to neural networks is very powerful, but the computational aspects of the model become even more formidable. A model very similar to neural networks is self-organizing maps (SMO). This model can be used as an unsupervised, exploratory technique or in a supervised fashion for prediction."

    "These models are often adversely affected by high correlation maong the predictor variables (since they use gradients to optimize the model parameters). Two approach for mitigating this issue is to pre-filer the predictors to remove the predictors that are associated with high correlations. Alternatively a feature extraction technique, such as principal component analysis, can be used prior to modeling to eliminate correlations. One positive side effect of both these approaches is that fewer model terms need to be optimized, thus improving computation time."

    "Like neural networks and partial least squares, MARS uses surrogate features instead of the original predictors. However, whereas PLS and neural networks are based on linear combinations of the predictors, MARS creates two contrasted versions of a predictor to enter the model. Also, the surrogate features in MARS are usually a function of only one or two predictors at a time. The nature of the MARS features breaks the predictor into two groups and models linear relationships between the predictor and the outcome in each group. Specifically, given a cut point for a predictor, two new features are \"hinge\" or \"hockey stick\" functions of the original. The \"left-hand\" feature has values of zero greater than the cut point, while the second feature is zero less than the cut point. The new features are added to a basic linear regression model to estimate the slopes and intercepts. In effect, this scheme creates a *piecewise linear model* where each new feature models an isolated portion of the original data.\n",

The nature of the predictor transformation makes such a large number of linear regression computationally feasible.\n",

    "There are several advantages to using MARS. First, the model automatically conducts feature selection; the model equation is independent of predictor variables that are not involved with any of the final model features. The second advantage is interpretability. Each hinge feature is responsible for modeling a specific region in the predictor space using a piecewise linear model. When the MARS model is additive, the contribution of each predictor can be isolated without the need to consider the others. This can be used to provide clear interpretation of how each predictor relates to the outcome. Finally, the MARS model requires very little pre-processing of the data; data transformation and the filtering of predictors are not needed. Correlated predictors do not drastically affect model performance, but they can complicate model interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to help understand the nature of how the predictors affect the model is to quantify their importance to the model. For MARS, one technique for doing this is to track the reduction in the root mean squared error (as measured using the GCV statistic) that occurs when adding a particular feature to the model. This reduction is attributed to the original predictors associated with the feature. These improvements in the model can be aggregated for each predictor as a relative measure of the impact on the model."

For regression, it is motivated in the framework of *robust regression* where we seek to minimize the effect of outliers on the regression equations. Also, there are several flavors of support vector regression and we focus on one particular technique called $\\epsilon$-insentitive regression.\n",

One drawback of minimizing SSE is that the parameter estimates can be influenced by just one observation that falls far from the overall trend in the data. When data may contain influential observations, an alternative minimization metric that is less sensitive, such as the Huber function, can be used to find the best parameter estimates. This function uses the squared residuals when they are \"small\" and uses the absolute residuals when the residuals are large.\n",

    "SVMs for regression use a function similar to the Huber function, with an important difference. Given a threshold set by the user (denoted as $\\epsilon$), data points with residuals within the threshold do not contribute to the regression fit while data points with an absolute difference greater than the threshold contribute a linear-scale amount. There are several consequences to this approach. First, since the squared residuals are not used, large outliers have a limited effect on the regression equation. Second, samples that the model fits well (i.e., the residuals are small) have no effect on the regression equation. In fact, if the threshold is set to a relatively large value, then the outliers are the only points that define the regression line. This is somewhat counterintuitive: the poorly predicted points define the line. However, this approach has been shown to be very effective in defining the mode."

    "The cost function is the main tool for adjusting the complexity of the model. When the cost is large, the model becomes very flexible since the effect of error is amplified. When the cost is small, the model will \"stiffen\" and become less likely to over-fit (but more likely to under-fit) because the contribution of the squared parameters is proportionally large in the modified error function. One could also tune the model over the size of the funnel (e.g., $\\epsilon$). However, there is a relationship between $\\epsilon$ and the cost parameter. Since the cost provides more flexibility for tuning the model, we suggest fixing a value for $\\epsilon$ and tuning over the other kernel parameters."

    "The KNN approach simply predicts a new sample using the K-cloest samples from the training set. It cannot be clearly summarized by a model. Instead, its construction is solely based on the individual samples from the training data. To predict a new sample for regression, KNN identifies that sample's KNNs in the predictor space. The predicted response for the new sample is then the mean of the K neighbors' responses. Other summary statistics, such as the median, can also be used in place of the mean to predict the new sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic KNN method depends on how the user defines distance between samples. Euclidean distance is the most commonly used metric and is defined as follows: $$(\\sum_{j=1}^P (x_{aj} - x_{bj})^2)^{1/2},$$ where $\\pmb{x}_a$ and $\\pmb{x}_b$ are two individual samples. Minkowski distance is a generalization of Euclidean distance and is defined as $$(\\sum_{j=1}^P |x_{aj} - x_{bj}|^q)^{1/q},$$ where $q > 0$. It is easy to see that when $q = 2$, then Minkowski distance is the same as Euclidean distance. When $q = 1$, then Minkowski distance is equivalent to Manhattan distance, which is a common metric used for samples with binary predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the KNN method fundamentally depends on distance between samples, the scale of the predictors can have a dramatic influence on the distances among samples. That is, predictors with the largest scales will contribute most to the distance between samples. To avoid the potential bias and to enable each predictor to contribute equally to the distance calculation, we recommend that all predictors be centered and scaled prior to performing KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the issue of scaling, using distances between samples can be problematic if one or more of the predictor values for a sample is missing, since it is then not possible to compute the distance between samples. If this is the case, then the analyst has a couple of options. First, either the samples or the predictors can be excluded from the analysis. If a predictor contains a sufficient amount of information across the samples, then an alternative approach is to impute the missing data using a naive estimator such as the mean of the predictor, or a nearest neighbor approach that uses only the predictors with complete information."

    "The elementray version of KNN is intuitive and straightforward and can produce decent predictions, especially when the response is dependent on the local predictor structure. However, this version does have some notable problems, of which researchers have sought solutions. Two commonly noted problems are computational time and the disconnect between local structure and the predictive ability of KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to predict a sample, distances between the sample and all other samples must be computed. Computational time therefore increases with n because the training data must be loaded into memory and because distances between the new sample and all of the training samples must be computed. To mitigate this problem, one can replace the original data with a less memory-intensive representation of the data that describes the locations of the original data. One specific example of this representation is a k-dimensional tree. A k-d tree orthogonally partitions the predictor space using a tree approach but with different rules. After the tree has been grown, a new sample is placed through the structure. Distances are only computed for those training observations in the tree that are close to the new sample. This approach provides significant computational improvements, especially when the number of training samples is much larger than the number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN method can have poor predictive performance when local predictor structure is not relevent to the response. Irrelevant or noisy predictors are one culprit, since these can cause similar samples to be driven away from each other in the predictor space. Hence, removing irrelevant, noise-laden predictors is a key pre-processing step for KNN. Another approach to enhancing KNN predictivity is to weight the neighbors' contribution to the prediction of a new sample based on their distances to the new sample. In this variation, training samples that are closer to the new sample contribute more to the predicted response, while those that are farther away contribute less to the predicted response."
