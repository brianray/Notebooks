However, we can often identify an unusual value by looking at a figure. When one or more samples are suspected to be outliers, the first step is to make sure that the values are scientifically valid and that no data recording errors have occured. Great care should be taken not to hastily remove or change values, especially if the sample size is small. With small sample sizes, apparent outliers might be a result of a skewed distribution where there are not yet enough data to see the skewness. Also, the outlying data may be an indication of a special part of the population under study that is just starting to be sampled. Depending on how the data were collected, a \"cluster\" of valid points that reside outside the mainstream of the data might belong to a different population than the other samples, e.g. *extrapolation* and *applicability domain*.

    "Usually, each category gets its own dummy variable that is a zero/one indicator for that group. Only four dummy variables are needed here, the fifth can be inferred. However, the decision to include all of the dummy variables can depend on the choice of the model. Models that include an intercept term, such as simple linear model, would have numerical issues if each dummy variable was included in the model. The reason is that, for each sample, these variables all add up to one and this would provide the same information as the intercept. If the model is insensitive to this type of issue, using the complete set of dummy variables would help improve interpretation of the model."

More simplistic models do not unless the user manually specifices which predictors should be nonlinear and in what way. Another technique to augment the prediction data for classification model is through the \"*class centroids*\", which are the centers of the predictor data for each class. For each predictor, the distance to each class centroid can be calculated and these distances can be added to the model."

Second, there is a loss of precision in the predictions when the predictors are categorized. Unfortunately, the predictive models that are most powerful are usually the least interpretable. The bottom line is that the perceived improvement in interpretability gained by manual categorization is usually offset by a significant loss in performance."

    "Note that the argument here is related to the *manual* categorization of predictors prior to model building. There are several models, such as classification/regression trees and multivariate adaptive regression splines, that estimate cut points in the process of model building. The difference between these methodologies and manual binning is that the models ues all the predictors to derive bins based on a single objective (such as maximizing accuracy). They evaluate many variable simultaneously and are usually based on statistically sound methodologies."
