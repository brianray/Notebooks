    "Classification models usually generate two types of predictions. Like regression models, classification models produce a continuous valued prediction, which is usually in the form of a probability (i.e., the predicted values of class membership for any individual sample are between 0 and 1 and sum to 1). In addition to a continuous prediction, classification models generate a predicted class, which comes in the form of a discrete category. For most practical applications, a discrete category prediction is required in order to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although classification models produce both of these types of predictions, often the focus is on the discrete prediction rather than the continuous prediciton. However, the probability estimates for each class can be very useful for gauging the model's confidence about the predicted classification. For example, an email message with a predicted probability of being spam of 0.51 would be classified the same as a message with a predicted probability of being spam of 0.99. While both messages would be treated the same by the filter, we would have more confidence that the second message was truly spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some applications, the desired outcome is the predicted class probabilities which are then used as inputs for other calculations. Consider an insurance company that wants to uncover and prosecute fraudulent claims. Using historical claims data, a classification model could be built to predict the probability of claim fraud. This probability would then be combined with the company's investigation costs and potential monetary loss to determine if pursuing the investigation is in the best financial interest of the insurance company.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, most classification models generate predicted class probabilities. However, when some models are used for classification, like neural networks and partial least squares, they produce continuous predictions that do not follow the definition of a probability. For example, a partial least squares classification model would ceate 0/1 dummy variables for each class and simultaneously model these values as a function of the predictors. When samples are predicted, the model predictions are not guaranteed to be within 0 and 1. For classification models like these, a transformation must be used to coerce the predictions into \"probability-like\" values so that they can be interpreted and used for classification. One such method is the *softmax transformation* \n",
    "$$\\hat{p}_l^{*} = {e^{\\hat{y}_l} \\over \\sum_{j=1}^C e^{\\hat{y}_j}}$$\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}_l$ is the numeric model prediciton for the $l^{\\text{th}}$ class and $\\hat{p}_l^{*}$ is the transformed value between 0 and 1. To be clear, no probability statement is being created by this transformation; it merely ensures that the predictions have the same mathematical qualities as probabilities."

    "Whether a classification model is used to predict spam email, or as inputs to insurance fraud, we desire that the estimated class probabilities are reflective of the true underlying probability of the sample. That is, the predicted class probability needs to be well-calibrated. To be well-calibrated, the probabilities must effectively reflect the true likelihood of the event of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to assess the quality of the class probabilities is using a calibration plot. For a given set of data, this plot shows some measure of the observed probability of an event versus the predicted class probability. One approach for creating this visualization is to score a collection of samples with known outcomes (preferably a test set) using a classification model. The next step is to bin the data into groups based on their class probabilities. For example, a set of bins might be [0, 10%], (10%, 20%], ..., (90%, 100%]. For each bin, determine the observed event rate. Suppose that 50 samples fell into the bin for class probabilities less than 10% and there was a single event. The midpoint of the bin is 5% and the observed event rate would be 2%. The calibration plot would display the midpoint of the bin on the x-axis and the observed event rate on the y-axis. If the points fall along a $45^{\\circ}$ line, the model has produced well-calibrated probabilities."

However, this does not take into account the relative frequencies of the classes in the training set.

The effect of severe class imbalances and some possible remedies are discussed later.\n",

The statistic can take on values between -1 and 1; a value of 0 means there is no aggreement between the observed and predicted classes. Negative values indicate that the prediction is in the *opposite* direction of the truth, but large negative values seldom occur, if ever, when working with predictive models. When the class distributions are equivalent, overall accuracy and Kappa are proportional. Depending on the context, Kappa values within 0.3 to 0.5 indicate reasonable aggreement. Suppose the accuracy for a model is high (90%) but the expected accuracy is also high (85%), the Kappa statistic would show moderate aggreement (Kappa = 1/3) between the observed and predicted classes."

    "Often, there is interest in having a single measure that reflects the false-positive and false-negative rates. Youden's J Index $$J = Sensitivity + Specificity - 1$$ measures the proportions of correctly predicted samples for both the event and non-event groups.

The most common method for combining sensitivity and specificity into a single value uses the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\n",

    "One often overlooked aspect of sensitivity and specificity is that they are conditional measures. Sensitivity is the accuracy rate for only the event population (and specificity for the non-events). Using the sensitivity and specificity, the obstetrician can make statements such as \"assuming that the fetus does not have Down syndrome, the test has an accuracy of 95%.\" However, these statements might not be helpful to a patient since, for a new samples, all that known is the prediction. The person using the model prediction is typically interested in unconditional queries such as \"what are the chances that the fetus has the genetic disorder?\" This depends on three values: the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test and the prevalence of the event in the population. Intuitively, if the event is rare, this should be reflected in the answer. Taking the prevalence into account, the analog to specificity is the *positive predicted value*, and the analog to specificity is the *negative predicted value*. These values make unconditional evaluations of the data. The positive predicted value answers the question \"what is the probability that this sample is an event?\" The formulas are \n",

In this figure, the numbers in parentheses are $(specificity, sensitivity)$. Note that the trajectory of the curve between (0, 0) and the 50% threshold is steep, indicating that the sensitivity is increasing at a greater rate than the decrease in specificity. However, when the sensitivity is greater than 70%, there is a more significant decrease in specificity than the gain in sensitivity.\n",

A completely ineffective model would result in an ROC curve that closely follows the $45^{\\circ}$ diagnoal line and would have an area under the ROC curve of approximately 0.5. To visually compare different models, their ROC curves can be superimposed on the same graph. Comparing ROC curves can be useful in contrasting two or more models with different predictor sets (for the same model), differnt tuning parameters (within model comparisons), or complete different classifiers (between models).\n",

A disadvantage of using the area under the curve to evaluate models is that it obscures information. When comparing models, it is common that no individual ROC curve is uniformly better than another. By summarizing these curves, there is a loss of information, especially if one particular area of the curve is of interest. The partial area under the ROC curve is an alternative that focuses on specific parts of the curve."

    "Lift charts are a visualization tool for assessing the ability of a model to detect events in a data set with two classes. Suppose a group of samples with M events is scored using the event class probability. When ordered by the class probability, one would hope that the events are ranked higher than the non-events. Lift charts do just this: rank the samples by their scores and determine the cumulative event rate as more samples are evaluated. In the optimal case, the M highest-ranked samples would contain all M events. When the model is non-informative, the highest ranked X% of the data would contain, on average, X events. The *lift* is the number of samples detected by a model above a completely random selection of samples.\n",
